-- 1、查询"01"课程比"02"课程成绩高的学生的信息及课程分数	
SELECT A.*,B.SSCORE AS SCORE01,C.SSCORE AS SCORE02
FROM STUDENT A JOIN SCORE B 
ON A.ID = B.SID AND B.CID = '01'
LEFT JOIN SCORE C 
ON A.ID = C.SID AND C.CID = '02' OR C.CID = NULL
WHERE B.SSCORE >C.SSCORE

或者这样做

SELECT A.* ,B.SSCORE AS SCORE01 ,C.SSCORE AS SSCORE02
FROM STUDENT A ,SCORE B ,SCORE C
WHERE A.ID = B.SID AND
	A.ID = C.SID AND
	B.CID = '01' AND
	C.CID = '02' AND
	B.SSCORE > C.SSCORE
